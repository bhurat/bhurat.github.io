        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p> My initial interest in the study of images began in photography. 
		While that interest has grown to be more about the mathematics and the applications, 
		I still love taking photos! 
		All the pictures on this website (outside of those taken from my research) are taken by me. 
		I used to post some on instagram (@thesickbee), but I haven't for a while. 
		Check it out if you're curious!

		<h2>Tabletop RPGs</h2>
        <p> Another interest of mine is in the playing and the design of Tabletop role-playing games. There is something really fun about designing rules whose wording promotes a certain kind of play. 
		In some way, its a bit like teaching! I haven't done much thats worth sharing, but below are some links to what I've developed.
